# Image Forgery Detection using Error Level Analysis (ELA) & CNN

This project detects forged (tampered) images using **Error Level Analysis (ELA)** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
The Flask-based interface allows users to upload an image and instantly receive:

- Authentic or Tampered classification  
- Confidence score  
- ELA visualization highlighting suspicious image regions  

This system is developed using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Flask, Matplotlib, and supporting libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time automated forgery detection  
- Error Level Analysis (ELA) preprocessing  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)–based classification  
- Clean and user-friendly Flask web interface  
- Accurate confidence percentage  
- Visual display: Original Image + ELA Image  
- Supports JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIF formats

## 📥 Download Trained Model (Required)

The trained model file **Image_forgery.h5** is not included in this repository because GitHub does not allow large binary files.

👉 **Download the trained model here:**
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CogtgM-yE-mBgIqFpbUB0v3oRi_nAQvi/view?usp=drive_link


After downloading, place the file in your project root:

```bash
image-forgery-detection-ELA-CNN/
└── Image_forgery.h5
```

> ⚠️ The app will NOT run without this file.
> Make sure the filename remains EXACTLY: **Image_forgery.h5**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads an image using the web interface.
2. The image is validated and stored in the server directory.
3. System performs **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**:

   * Image is re-saved at 90% quality
   * Difference between original vs. recompressed is extracted
   * ELA highlights inconsistencies caused by tampering
4. ELA image is resized, normalized, and fed into the CNN model.
5. CNN predicts:

   * **Original** or **Tampered**
   * Confidence percentage
6. The result page displays:

   * Original image
   * ELA output
   * Prediction + confidence score

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Flask**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **OpenCV**
* **Pillow (PIL)**
* **Matplotlib**
* **NumPy**
* **Scikit-Learn**

## 🧪 Dataset

This model was trained using a dataset containing:

* Authentic (original) images
* Tampered (forged) images

Forgery types include:

* Copy-move
* Splicing
* Region manipulation
* Color & lighting edits

All training images undergo ELA preprocessing before feeding into the CNN.
